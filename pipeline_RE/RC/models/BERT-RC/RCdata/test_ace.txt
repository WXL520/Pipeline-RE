<e1> American </e1> <e2> military </e2> .12 But the key question , which <e1> I </e1> try to address in the book , is what do <e2> you </e2> do after that ?12 What kind of authority do <e1> you </e1> create in a <e2> society </e2> going through this kind of transition .12 and how do <e1> you </e1> know that the local <e2> Iraqi </e2> citizens will make up this government or , in fact , interested in democracy ?12 and how do <e1> you </e1> know that the local Iraqi <e2> citizens </e2> will make up this government or , in fact , interested in democracy ?12 and how do <e1> you </e1>

democracy ?12 and how do you know that the local Iraqi <e1> citizens </e1> will make up this <e2> government </e2> or , in fact , interested in democracy ?12 well , the key here is the only way to get that kind of legitimate <e1> government </e1> to have <e2> it </e2> look good is to hold elections .12 But if <e1> you </e1> hold elections , <e2> you </e2> stop the whole process of building a rule of law , creating courts , creating administration .12 <e1> We </e1> 've seen in the past in <e2> Bosnia </e2> for example , you held elections and all of the old ethnic thugs get into power
